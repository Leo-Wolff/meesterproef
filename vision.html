				<p>
					Maladaptive daydreaming disorder isn’t a commonly known disorder yet
					still people struggle with it. People with the disorder struggle
					balancing between reality and fantasy and sometimes they even blend
					together. It can be a disorientating disorder and since the
					maladaptive daydreaming isn’t within the DSM-5 people can’t get a
					medical diagnosis for it, which in turns means lack of proper
					treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Daydreams are often seen as a positive experience, being able to
					daydream a whole storyline even more so. However, this website aims to
					show that “too much of a good thing” counts for daydreaming too. Some
					of the symptoms of the disorder include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Disassociating</li>
					<li>Struggles with executive function</li>
					<li>Pacing or mouth movements lined up with your daydreaming</li>
					<li>Daydreaming for an excessive amount of time (hours)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you think you mean have the disorder know that you are not alone
					and much like riding a bike in time things will get easier.
