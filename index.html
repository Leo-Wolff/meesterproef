							Ackaleth… a unknown continent that is definitely not within the
							world that I’m familiar with. I’ve been missing for days now,
							three to be exact.
						</p>
						<p>
							Speaking of, welcome to day three of Adrien feeling like crap,
							it’s gonna be a bit of a theme for a while it seems.
						</p>
						<p>
							I mean can you blame me? After three days of being here I have:
						</p>
						<p>
							Almost fallen to my death, been threatened, had my soul leave my
							body apparently, found out I’m in a DIFFERENT WORLD, found out I’m
							surrounded by dying people, had my daydreams essentially remove a
							day from my life, and too much hiking.
						</p>
						<p>Yaaay.</p>
						<p>
							And no one, including me, had the slightest idea how I got
							transported here nor how to get back. How long would I be stuck
							here? If so much has happened within three days, what else awaited
							me?

							Her younger brother and her had managed to get on their horses as
							they and four other guards rode beside them as a shield. They were
							galloping out of the city as soon as possible. Whatever had sieged
							her father’s kingdom, it sounded like they were winning and they
							were the only two who managed to get out on time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Where the rest of her family was and if they survived, she was
							unsure.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>I don’t want to see this.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							All they could do was gallop at their fastest through the kingdom,
							hoping they will be able to cross the border in time to guarantee
							their own safety. Stella was taught to sit on her saddle with both
							legs on one side since that was more appropriate as a princess,
							and although it was a fine sitting position that still allowed
							Orion to run, once she realised Orion would have to jump over
							obstacles the situation seemed less than ideal.
						</p>
						<p>
							She was forced to have her legs on either side by the time she saw
							what had happened to her castle.
						</p>
						<p>
							A bright red light shot up from the highest tower, the sky
							becoming crimson as it expanded.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Let this scene just be over with, it’s too cruel.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							The rest of her family was gone at this point, I knew that much.
							And I also understood no one else was going to make it. The group
							just kept running, their desperation increasing evermore until
							finally the first mistake happened. Her younger brother didn’t
							make the jump, he had fallen off his horse.
						</p>
						<p>
							“KEEP GOING!” yelled one of the guards at Stella as she
							reluctantly continued her escape. All of the guards got off their
							horses and assisted the young prince but the delay proved fatal.
							The light had expanded so far out that it had reached them, Stella
							saw them all turn to stone.
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing her death was fast approaching she encouraged Orion to go
							faster. Her hand basically reaching out for something that was not
							even there. The symbolism didn’t pass me, I knew I myself was
							doing the same right now. Moreso, I needed to vent and I felt like
							this whole scene was just one big rant of my own crippling
							loneliness. Stella didn’t deserve it, but I couldn’t stop it
							either. This was her story, I somehow knew I couldn’t change that.
						</p>
						<p>
							I felt ever more guilty as time started running out, the red light
							catching up as Orion galloped for dear life. Suddenly, she heard
							cawing and to her right saw a bright red bird she had never laid
							eyes on before in her life. The creature flew right besides her as
							the border approached ever closer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Then, right before the dark spell would’ve hit Orion’s tail, they
							had crossed it. Stella wouldn’t have known that was the case if it
							wasn’t for the fact that the light for some reason did not wish to
							continue any further.
						</p>
						<p>
							From the sudden shock of her escape, she unknowingly had pulled
							Orion’s reins. The force of the stop caused her to fall of her
							horse hard enough for her to pass out.
						</p>
						<p>
							She laid there unconscious in the grass as the spell retreated.
							Her entire kingdom forever turned to stone. However, her phoenix
							had joined her side now, and a couple from the local village found
							her. It did not take long for them to figure out that Princess
							Stella was now the only member of her royal family left alive.

							By the time I came to, it was already well past dinner time. The
							day had become a haze in my memory, spend either lying down or
							pacing about. I had no clue what it must’ve looked like for the
							campers. I didn’t care about that though.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have a daydreaming disorder, you know how consuming a binge
							like this can be. How it steals your time and life away from you
							until things are resolved. How it numbs your brain like a drug,
							and you can’t get off the high until you are satisfied. Much like
							a drug… it was a great feeling, and lethally addictive.
						</p>

						<p>
							When I mean lethal, I sort of mean it. Because when I look back on
							my life, it was only a half-lived one. One life living. One life
							wandering.
						</p>
						<p>
							In all honesty reader, living a half-life hurts, a lot. Breathing
							hurts, a lot. Existing hurts, a lot. As if everything was a
							suffocating gas that I was forced to take in. That pain has been
							with me for what feels like forever, although I have somewhat
							grown numb to it.
						</p>
						<p>
							That is why I knew I would never be done wanting to drift off. It
							was a life sentence. However, for now, I was satisfied. I had
							compensated my lost daydream time from yesterday.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>This can’t happen again though.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							I had to reaffirm myself of that. I was in a camp full of people
							with a terminal illness that may or may not be contagious, on a
							mountain I could not navigate alone, in a continent that is
							completely unknown to me. And seeing as how so many of the campers
							appeared to have scarring, I couldn’t afford to be too ignorant.
						</p>
						<p>
							If Cyprian said my daydreams could be useful – which would be the
							very first time that was a thing – then I had to focus on giving
							them practical use. What I did today was a waste of time, it was
							leisure.

							“You awake?” I looked at the source of the voice. I had recognised
							it; it was the same American accented voice from yesterday. I also
							remembered this voice heavily objected to my being here, but
							that’s when he had assumed I was Kethterran. This time, I could
							finally put a face to the voice. He had most of the usual traits
							that the celekaine seemed to possess here; fur attire, scars, and
							celekaine markings. However, he seemed on the older side of the
							people here, which wasn’t saying a lot. Estelle was very much the
							odd person out by being a senior, everyone else seemed to either
							be in their teens or twenties.
						</p>
						<p>
							The fact that all of them were dying was a depressing thought.
						</p>
						<p>
							This guy had his markings right within his right eye. The whole
							thing was matt black, only a small outline of white still
							remained. The disease was clearly trying to take over the entire
							thing and then continue its vicious hunt for the rest of the body.
							His left eye showed what his right eye should’ve been, a soft blue
							shade.
						</p>
						<p>
							I nodded and he handed me a plate of food that mainly consisted of
							berries and meat.
						</p>
						<p>
							“Thank you.” I said awkwardly. He furrowed his brows and his
							piercing gaze felt like daggers.
						</p>
						<p>
							“It’s fine.” He replied with no emotion whatsoever. I attempted a
							conversation by saying,
						</p>
						<p>
							“I’m not Kethterran you know…” He looked at me for a moment
							seemingly in thought.
						</p>
						<p>
							“I know.” I didn’t know what to say to that, so an uncomfortable
							silence ensued. Great.
						</p>
						<p>
							He offered this time to continue the chat by saying, “is that how
							people of your world normally rest?”
						</p>
						<p>“Huh?” He elaborated,</p>
						<p>“The pacing.”</p>
						<p>
							“Oh… no that’s… that’s a me thing.” I didn’t want to tell him
							about my daydreaming disorder or the daydreams themselves. Estelle
							and Cyprian knowing was about as much as I wanted to share.
							However, he spotted my reluctance and his emotionless display
							revealed to have hidden frustration.
						</p>
						<p>
							“Okay then. Anyways, enjoy your meal. Alexandra worked hard on
							it.” I ignored his shift in tone. I simply nodded and replied once
							again,
						</p>
						<p>
							“Thank you.” I thought the conversation was over but the guy kept
							looking at me. I could’ve sworn that the look had a hint of pity
							within it. “What is it?” I asked. He shook his head in response
							before walking away,
						</p>
						<p>“Nothing… Nothing.”</p>

							After dinner by the campfire I had heard from a woman, who
							introduced herself as Atiya, that my new clothes had been
							finished. Apparently the man who handed me my dinner, Markus, was
							supposed to tell me that they were done. It did not surprise me
							why he didn’t. He didn’t seem to like me very much.
						</p>
						<p>
							I couldn’t really blame him though. It sounded like Kethterrans
							were a real threat and if they thought I was one at first… well it
							wasn’t a great start to my stay here. Never mind the whole ‘I’m
							from a whole other universe/dimension/world/whatever’. I collected
							my new fur attire and immediately realised that these clothes have
							a getting dressed process to them that I have not been informed
							about.

						<p>
							Fortunately, Kamitsu had just entered the tent and saw my
							desperate look. Thus she instructed me and let me get dressed
							privately in her tent that she shared with Sharaf.
						</p>
						<p>
							Her tent was a goldish one, one of the few ones that didn’t seem
							to match with any of the others in terms of style. However, the
							inside was a lot more modest and was mainly filled with books. The
							books got me excited. They weren’t the kind of covers you normally
							buy at a modern bookstore. These books were leather-bound, that
							classic book look.
						</p>
						<p>
							You’re a reader, you understand the hype. You want to smell it, I
							do too. We’re on the same page… pun intended.
						</p>
						<p>As I was getting dressed Kamitsu said from outside the tent,</p>
						<p>“Feeling rested?”</p>
						<p>“Not really.” I replied with an exhausted chuckle.</p>

						<p>
							“Really? You didn’t seem to be doing a lot.” I didn’t reply. Once
							again, I didn’t want to open up about this side of me. It felt too
							personal. “Does it have to do with the task Cyprian mentioned?”
						</p>
						<p>
							“Kind of.” Was all that I was willing to say about it. It was
							silent for a good while. Despite Kamitsu’s instructions I was
							still struggling a fair bit with the clothing.
						</p>
						<p>
							“So before Cyprian left he suggested it could be a good idea to
							have you hike up to the hot springs. I was thinking… you could do
							that tomorrow. The springs are a spiritual area. I don’t know what
							you have to do but he said it could help.”
						</p>
						<p>
							“Maybe… I’m not sure.” My heart was pounding for some reason. I
							think it was a mix of getting dressed whilst having a conversation
							with a person I had only known for two days, and the subject
							matter itself.
						</p>
						<p>
							“I’ll ask who wants to accompany you, it’s not far. It’s a half
							day’s climb at most.” I was dressed at this point, but another
							question had been burning on my mind ever since this morning.
						</p>

						<p>
							“I hope I’m not a burden… am I?” There was a silence before
							Kamitsu responded,
						</p>
						<p>
							“You’re just inexperienced, that’s all.” I appreciated the
							directness, but the truth still stung somewhat. My silence must’ve
							motivated Kamitsu to make an attempt to cheer me up, “we all had
							to adjust to this life too, I wouldn’t worry about it.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Could I adjust? Did I want to? It seemed the longer I was here the
							more questions I got.
